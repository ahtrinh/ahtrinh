Iâ€™m an Information Security Analyst with a background in Cybersecurity Engineering and a strong interest in vulnerability management, threat hunting, and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). While gaining professional experience in the GovCon space and working toward an active security clearance, I use this GitHub to showcase hands-on projects that demonstrate technical skills in vulnerability scanning, SIEM log analysis, and security automation. 

My goal is to bridge technical defense with compliance frameworks, documenting labs and sandbox experiments that reflect both my current learning journey and my long-term commitment to becoming a well-rounded cybersecurity professional.
